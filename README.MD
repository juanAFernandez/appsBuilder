Not perfect, but **REAL**

Just a tool to create the scafold base for your project based of MEAN stack, ready to continue with your own business logic, 
but with the basics already working.

## How to use

For now in our first etage just only executing

`tsx src/index.t <projectName>`

Yes we love lowerCamelCase name types.
